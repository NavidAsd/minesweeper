# KONNICHIWA

Hey budding coders (just like me), if u can add to my code i"ll be happy to accept your Pull Requests.
The my_code folder is all hardwork of mine, SO EXCEPT THAT ONE , if you wanna add to the code in original_code folder go ahead.

## Example:
  In the file base.py
  
    1. specify value of n instead of taking input.
    
    2. try forming that list(arr) through diff method like list.append() or list.extend().
    
  In the file bomb.py
  
    1. write the value of x and y in the conditional statement in more consised way.( Basic math sttuff !!)
    
    2. try forming that list(arr) through diff method like list.append() or list.extend().
